This is my attempt at creating a program that can receive input from the user to add values to a vector.  The program then sorts the vector from least to greates
and then calculates the median and the mode.  I originally wanted to have the program exit the loop for input is the user entered "x" but was unable to accomplish
that just yet.  I have completed up to chapter 8 of the Rust tutorial.
